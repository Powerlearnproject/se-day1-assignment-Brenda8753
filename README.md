#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well defined scientific principles, methods and procedures.It ensures that software meets user needs while being cost-effective, scalable, and maintainable.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference)-During this time, software development faced significant challenges, including poor reliability, high costs, and missed deadlines.
The term "software engineering" was officially introduced, emphasizing the need for structured, disciplined approaches to software development.
The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s – 1980s)-The introduction of structured programming (by figures like Edsger Dijkstra) emphasized breaking programs into smaller, modular functions using control structures like loops and conditionals.
Languages such as Pascal, C, and Ada were developed to support structured programming.
The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001 – Present)-In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced, promoting iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility.
Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban became popular, significantly improving software delivery speed and responsiveness to changes.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Analysis- user needs and requirements are gathered
2. Planning-deciding the best approach for development.
3. Design-Defines data flow, user interfaces, and database structures.
4. Implementation (Coding/Development)-Actual coding of the software takes place.
5. Testing-Identifies and fixes bugs or errors in the software.
6. Deployment-The software is released for end-users.
7. Maintenance & Support-Software is monitored for performance and security issues.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall and Agile methodologies take different approaches to software development. Waterfall follows a structured, step-by-step process, making it ideal for projects with fixed requirements, like healthcare systems or banking software, where precision and compliance are key. Agile, on the other hand, is flexible and iterative, allowing for continuous feedback and changes, making it better suited for mobile apps, e-commerce, or startup projects that need quick adaptations. While Waterfall ensures a predictable timeline and budget, Agile allows for faster updates and improvements. Many teams now use a hybrid approach to balance structure with flexibility.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code based on project requirements. They design software architecture, debug issues, and collaborate with other team members to ensure functionality and performance.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Focuses on testing and ensuring software quality by identifying bugs, running automated/manual tests, and verifying that the software meets requirements. They work closely with developers to ensure a smooth user experience and adherence to standards.

Project Manager : Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project. They manage timelines, allocate resources, communicate with stakeholders, and ensure the project stays on track, balancing scope, time, and budget constraints.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
DEs and Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools in software development. An IDE provides an all-in-one coding environment with features like code completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting, making development faster and more efficient. Examples include VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm. On the other hand, a VCS helps teams collaborate by tracking changes, managing versions, and preventing code loss. Git, often used with GitHub or GitLab, is the most popular, while SVN and Mercurial are also used in some projects. Together, IDEs and VCS improve productivity, organization, and teamwork in software development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face several challenges, including tight deadlines, unclear requirements, debugging complex issues, keeping up with new technologies, and team collaboration difficulties. To overcome these, they can use agile methodologies to break tasks into manageable sprints, ensuring steady progress. Clear communication with stakeholders helps clarify requirements early, reducing misunderstandings. Debugging can be tackled by writing clean, modular code and using tools like log analyzers and automated testing. Staying updated with new technologies requires continuous learning through online courses and industry events. For better collaboration, version control systems (like Git) and team communication platforms (like Slack or Jira) help keep everyone aligned. By adopting these strategies, software engineers can navigate challenges effectively and improve productivity.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Software testing ensures reliability and performance by identifying bugs at different stages of development. Unit testing focuses on individual components or functions to verify they work as expected, helping catch errors early. Integration testing checks how different modules interact, ensuring seamless communication between components. System testing evaluates the entire software in a real-world environment to confirm it meets functional and technical requirements. Finally, acceptance testing validates whether the software meets user expectations and business needs before release. Each type of testing plays a crucial role in maintaining software quality, reducing failures, and delivering a smooth user experience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting clear and effective instructions to guide AI models in generating accurate responses. It improves AI interactions by ensuring relevant and useful outputs, making it essential for tasks like content creation, customer support, and problem-solving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the main differences between electric and gasoline cars, including cost, maintenance, and environmental impact."

The improved prompt is more effective because it is specific, clear, and concise. It tells the AI exactly what information is needed, reducing ambiguity and ensuring a more focused and relevant response. Instead of a broad, general answer, the AI will provide detailed comparisons on key aspects, making the response more useful.
